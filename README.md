# Spotify-Song-Popularity-Prediction-Model
The project aimed to predict the popularity of Spotify songs based on various features such as acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, and valence. The steps involved included data preprocessing, where the dataset was cleaned and prepared for analysis, followed by splitting the data into training and testing sets.A machine learning model was then trained using the training set and evaluated for performance using the testing set. The final model was used to make predictions on song popularity, and the results were visualized to assess the model's effectiveness.

 Project Highlights :

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing :
   - Gathered Spotify song data including features like acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, and valence.
   - Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.
2. Data Splitting :
   - Split the data into training and testing sets to ensure the model's performance could be evaluated.
3. Model Training :
   - Trained a machine learning model using the training data to predict song popularity.
4. Model Evaluation :
   - Evaluated the model's performance on the testing data to measure accuracy and effectiveness.
5. Prediction :
   - Used the trained model to make predictions on the popularity of songs.
6. Result Visualization :
   - Visualized the results to better understand the model's performance and interpret the outcomes.
